# How do I QA?
Introduction to acceptance testing

FORK THE PROJECT!

# Database setup

We're using postgres. Make sure it's running :)

Ubuntu: `sudo -u postgres psql template1`  
OSX: `psql template1`

**Fill in your desired password** in the `db/development_setup_script.sql` - if you leave it empty you might have to [change your hba_conf](https://gist.github.com/p1nox/4953113).

Then in the pql console run: `\i <PATH_TO_PROJECT>/db/development_setup_script.sql`
Exit console by typing `\q`

**Copy database.yml.sample to database.yml and fill in the password you chose earlier.**

Run `bundle install`
Then `rake db:reseed` to populate development environment with example data.
